* Support for the mouse scroll wheel actions
* Support direct commands (i.e. not via clickables)
* Hook in the Export() functions so that other plugins can be used at

* Add JSON files for more aircraft
* Complete the documentation

== Low priority

* CBOR support, only if there is clear need for it
